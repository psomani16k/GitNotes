Been working on rewriting the ui for the past 3 days. Putting a terminal like interface on the GitPushPull screen has proven to be much harder than I initially thought. As it turns out I need a way to buffer the messages on the rust end or they get "lost" and are not recieved by dart.

The rest of the apps ui seems quits responsive and fluid and I am quite happy with it and I really want to finsh this terminal like interface before leaving the project for sometime. Maybe I'll take a week off from writing code tho.... as it turns out sitting infront of a computer screen for the entire day for 4 straight days is indeed tiring and not the best of ideas (especially if you have a quiz in 2 days and a million other things to take care of...).
