# GitNotes

A Markdown first notes app with git based syncing and version control.

## Building Yourself

1. Make sure Flutter and the Rust compiler is installed on your machine. Also add the `Android NDK` to your path variable.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install rinf on your machine in the cloned directory using cargo

    `cargo install rinf@6.15.0`

4. Run `rinf message` to generate messages between Dart and Rust.
5. Run `flutter build apk` to build the app.
6. Profit.

## FAQs

1. Windows, Linux, MacOS, iOS and Web support?
    - **Desktop platforms**: Not anytime soon, also the need seems low as there are pretty robust applications that support markdown and git both (vscode!).
    - **Web**: Nope.
    - **iOS**: I would love to support it, but I don't have the resources (A Mac and an iPhone) to make it possible, nor do I have the kind of financial to pay up for the recurring fees that Apple charges.
